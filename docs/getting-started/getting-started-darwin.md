## Install Go

1. Download Go for MacOS via Homebrew. (Please see [here](https://github.com/stackrox/rox/blob/master/EXPECTED_GO_VERSION) for the latest version used at StackRox that you should download and [here](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/go) for the possible Homebrew formulae).
    # This installs the latest version of Go
    brew install go
     
    # If the version of Go used in the rox repo is not the latest, install the prior version like this, for example:
    brew install go@1.16

### Verify

1. Run the command to inspect the version of Go that was just installed. It should be what you expect:
    ```
    $ go version
    
    go version go1.xx darwin/amd64. # This should reflect the version you just installed
    ```

    $ cd ~/go/src/github.com/stackrox/
    $ git clone git@github.com:stackrox/workflow.git
    ```
2. Follow the steps in the [repo's README](https://github.com/stackrox/workflow/blob/master/README.md)

### Verify

```
    $ roxhelp

    /Users/ross/go/src/github.com/stackrox/workflow/bin/roxhelp <command_name> (to print help for command <command_name>)
    /Users/ross/go/src/github.com/stackrox/workflow/bin/roxhelp --list-all (to list all available Rox commands)
