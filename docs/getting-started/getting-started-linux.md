    $ git clone git@github.com:stackrox/workflow.git
    ```

    $ roxhelp

    Usage:
    /Users/ross/go/src/github.com/stackrox/workflow/bin/roxhelp <command_name> (to print help for command <command_name>)
    /Users/ross/go/src/github.com/stackrox/workflow/bin/roxhelp --list-all (to list all available Rox commands)
```
